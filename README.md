## Summary: 
Soil condition is instrumental for decision making of selecting the best crops. The elements of the soil that are critical for crop selection are composed of nitrogen (N), phoshphorus (P), potassium (K), and the pH. Assessing these levels, however, can be a costly and time-consuming process; often, leading farmers to prioritize only metrics that are within their budget. In this project, I execute a logistic regression classification for deciding on which crop to plant each season, while also identifying the single most important feature for predictive performance.
